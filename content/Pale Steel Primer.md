# Welcome to [[Elysian Glossary#Elysium|Elysium]], [[Elysian Glossary#Voyager of Fortune|voyager]]!
**[[Elysian Glossary#Elysium|Elysium]]** is a sword-and-sorcery science-fantasy world of floating islands adrift over the endless [[Elysian Glossary#Ivory Sea|Ivory Sea]]. In [[Elysian Glossary#Elysium|Elysium]], skyships and beasts soar the skies between prospering industrialized cities of faction politics and nobility, frontier [[Elysian Glossary#Shard|shards]] that can seem to appear overnight from the pale itself, and ancient ruins coveting lost [[Elysian Glossary#Arcana|Arcana]], glittering hoards, and lethal consequences.
> [!question]- Why a site?
> Because [[Elysian Glossary#Elysium|Elysium]] is an entirely homebrewed setting it can be easy to make an incorrect assumption about the setting, after all, how would you even be able to know better if I haven't explicitly told you? That is why I'm putting together this site as a touchstone of player facing information for easy access!
> 
> Most of the proper and common nouns I've coined can be hovered over to see their definition in the [[Elysian Glossary]], and over time more pages will be added.

*Fate brings together six disparate souls within the golden city of [[Elysian Glossary#Eldrathen's Crest|Eldrathen's Crest]], built atop sprawling, immutable ruins that gleam with a dull golden hue.* 

*Its people hum with lively preparations for it's centennial celebrations; the parks and public spaces in Hearthwright are adorned with iconic gilded roses, while the businesses in the Golden Exchange toil to fulfill the rapidly approaching deadline.* 
# Campaign Structure
We're playing **Pale Steel** for two reasons; one is to learn and play Draw Steel, and the other is to play a game that can form around everyone's idiosyncratic schedules. This is why Pale Steel will be a ***Multi-Table Shared World Campaign***.
## Splitting the Table
At the start of the campaign some of you may already know some of the other player characters, and some you don't. This means that most sessions won't actually include the entire group of 6 players, especially during the tutorial sessions.

As the story develops, your stories will continue to intertwine more and more. At which point it will be up to you to decide what people your character brings along on their quests, or what quests your character would seek to join.
## Player Agency
Unlike most published adventures where a string of events or scenes the DM or writer expects to happen has been plotted out beforehand, I'm writing Pale Steel to be a set of circumstances.[^1] 
This doesn't mean there won't be a "main story", for lack of a better term. Instead, our main story will emerge from your interactions (or lack thereof) with the different pieces and players in the world.
