# Welcome to [[Elysium]], [[Voyager of Fortune|voyager]]!
**[[Elysium]]** is a sword-and-sorcery science-fantasy world of floating islands adrift over the endless [[Ivory Sea]]. In [[Elysium]], skysails and beasts soar through clouds between the prospering industrialized cities of faction politics and nobility, frontier [[Shard|shards]] that can seem to appear overnight from the pale itself, and ancient ruins coveting lost [[Arcana]], glittering hoards, and lethal consequences.
> [!question] Why a site?
> Because [[Elysium]] is an entirely homebrewed setting it can be easy to make an incorrect assumption about the setting, after all, how would you even be able to know better if I haven't explicitly told you? That is why I'm putting together this site as a touchstone of player facing information for easy access!
> 
> Most of the proper and common nouns I've coined can be hovered over to see their definition in the [Glossary](https://gridith.github.io/elysium-wiki/Elysian-Glossary/), and over time more pages will be added.

![[Pale Steel Header.png]]
*Fate brings together six disparate souls within the golden city of [[Eldrathen's Crest]], built atop sprawling, immutable ruins that gleam with a dull golden hue.* 

*Its people hum with lively preparations for it's centennial celebrations; the parks and public spaces in [[Hearthwright]] are adorned with iconic [[Gilded Roses]], while the businesses in the [[Golden Exchange]] toil to fulfill the rapidly approaching deadline.* 
# Campaign Structure
We're playing **Pale Steel** for two reasons; one is to learn and play Draw Steel, and the other is to play a game that can form around everyone's idiosyncratic schedules. This is why Pale Steel will be a ***Multi-Table Shared World Campaign***.
## Splitting the Table
At the start of the campaign some of you may already know some of the other player characters, and some you don't. This means that most sessions won't actually include the entire group of 6 players, especially during the tutorial sessions.

As the story develops, your stories will continue to intertwine more and more. At which point it will be up to you to decide what people your character brings along on their quests, or what quests your character would seek to join.
## Player Agency
Unlike most published adventures where a string of events or scenes the DM or writer expects to happen has been plotted out beforehand, I'm writing Pale Steel to be a set of circumstances.[^1] 
This doesn't mean there won't be a "main story", for lack of a better term. Instead, our main story will emerge from your interactions (or lack thereof) with the different pieces and players in the world.
## The First Sessions
We'll be starting off with two different types of session, [[Appendix|Appendices]] and [[Prologue|Prologues]].
We'll be using the [[Appendix|appendix]] sessions before and during the campaign to expand on smaller, often personal, elements of the story. Everyone is going to be playing through a part of their backstory as part of the opening [[Appendix|appendices]].
The [[Prologue|prologue]] sessions will be scheduled by me to serve a structured intro before the training wheels are removed and the full sandbox opens up, where each of you are paired off and started on the first legs of your journey.

# Closing Remarks
Before we kick thing off, though, I want to share one small but important request.

I care a great deal about this campaign. I’ve put real time and energy into building it, and I’m excited to explore it together. Because of that, I’d love for us to treat this game the way we would any meaningful hobby; like a sports club, rehearsal, or team project. Something we show up for intentionally.

That means bringing our focus to the table, staying engaged during sessions, and maintaining space for it in our schedules when we can. At the end of the day, I want this campaign to feel like something we’re building together. The more we invest in it, the more we’ll get out of it. 

If for any reason you think this campaign isn't for you, we did after all start on it *months ago*, then you can reach out to me in private so we can work out what works best for us all!
